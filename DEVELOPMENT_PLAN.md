## Implementation Priority:

1. **IMMEDIATE (Week 1-2):** Nginx RTMP + FFmpeg + Basic Recording
2. **SHORT TERM (Week 3-4):** WebSocket + Real-time Updates + Storage Management
3. **MEDIUM TERM (Week 5-8):** Security + Advanced Recording + Monitoring
4. **LONG TERM (Week 9+):** Production Deployment + Advanced Features

## Next Steps:

1. Start with Nginx RTMP server setup
2. Integrate FFmpeg for video processing
3. Implement basic recording functionality
4. Add WebSocket for real-time updates
5. Build storage management system

This plan will transform the current basic system into a fully functional multi-camera streaming platform as specified in the requirements.
