# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-camera RTMP streaming platform that allows administrators to manage multiple cameras, generate unique RTMP links, view live streams, enable recording, and provide API access for external integrations. The platform will serve as a private streaming solution (not for YouTube/Facebook) with comprehensive camera management and monitoring capabilities.

## Requirements

6. WHEN camera status changes THEN the system SHALL update dashboard statistics in real-time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to add new cameras with detailed information, so that I can generate unique RTMP links for each camera.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new camera THEN the system SHALL require camera name, company, model, serial number, location, and place

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the camera list THEN the system SHALL display all cameras with their details (name, company, model, serial number, location, place, status)
2. WHEN editing a camera THEN the system SHALL allow modification of all camera details except serial number
3. WHEN deactivating a camera THEN the system SHALL perform a soft delete (mark as inactive) rather than permanent deletion
4. WHEN activating a camera THEN the system SHALL restore the camera to active status
5. WHEN a camera is deactivated THEN the system SHALL stop accepting streams from that camera's RTMP link
6. WHEN camera details are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain the same RTMP link
